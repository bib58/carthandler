🚀 **Just built a Cart System in React.js!** 🛒

I recently worked on a fun little project that mimics the real-world shopping cart experience — adding items, removing them, and updating the cart count dynamically — all using **ReactJS**.

🔧 **What I implemented:**
- Add to Cart functionality 🟢  
- Remove from Cart support 🔴  
- Cart badge updates in real time 🔄
  
## Learnt **state management**, **component re-renders**, and **React event handling**. 

👨‍💻 **Tech used:** Redux in React.js
